KiCad versions of my circuits

Many of my boards have the Open Source Hardware logo on them. Using this logo
requires having an open source license and publishing the source. In order to
support this, I have the URL of this repository engraved onto the boards themselves.

I have made a release for the Wearable Pocketometer boards, and intend to make a release
each time I have a board made.

All boards which have been released since September 2020 have enough information
to construct a bill of materials. This is in the form of Digikey part numbers attached
to each part in the KiCad .sch files.

Featured projects:

* Wearable Pocketometer -- IMU/GPS recording device designed to be worn by a roller-coaster passenger. 
It has a component that goes on your shoulder or hat, one in your pocket, and one in your shoe.
